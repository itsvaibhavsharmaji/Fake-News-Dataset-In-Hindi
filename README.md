Introduction:
With the proliferation of digital media, the spread of misinformation and fake news has become a pressing concern. To address this challenge in the Hindi-speaking community, I have created a comprehensive dataset by scraping articles from reputable Hindi news sources such as Aaj Tak, Amar Ujala, Dainik Bhaskar, and Vishwas News.

Dataset Creation Process:
Using tools like Selenium and ParseHub, I scraped news articles from various online platforms. Subsequently, I utilized the powerful Newspaper3k library to generate article summaries and extract author names, enriching the dataset with valuable metadata.
Impact:
This dataset serves as a valuable resource for researchers, data scientists, and machine learning enthusiasts interested in combating the spread of fake news in the Hindi language. By providing access to a comprehensive collection of authentic and deceptive news articles, this project empowers researchers to develop and evaluate advanced machine learning models for fake news detection.
